\# Personal AI Assistant (Gen AI Project)



Hi, I'm \*\*Shivakumar (Shiva) Dongari\*\* 👋



I'm currently part of an \*\*AI Training program\*\*, and this repository is created for \*\*Git \& GitHub Task 1\*\*.



\## About Me



\- Interested in \*\*AI, data, Power BI, SQL, and automation\*\*.

\- I want to build tools that reduce mental load and make day-to-day life easier.

\- Currently learning \*\*Gen AI, Git/GitHub, and modern development tools\*\*.



\## Project: Personal AI Assistant



This project is about building a \*\*personal AI assistant\*\* that:

\- Understands natural, casual language  

&nbsp; > e.g., \_"Bro, remind me to pay my insurance on Monday morning"\_

\- Turns it into structured reminders/tasks

\- Helps with planning, organization, and life management



\### Tech \& Concepts (planned)



\- \*\*Gen AI / LLMs\*\* (for conversation and reasoning)

\- \*\*Reminders and tasks logic\*\*

\- \*\*Git \& GitHub\*\* for version control and collaboration

\- (Later) possibly a \*\*web interface\*\* or \*\*PWA\*\* for daily use



\## Why this repo exists



\- To practice \*\*Git commands\*\* (clone, add, commit, push).

\- To manage my \*\*Gen AI project\*\* in a clean, professional way.

\- To serve as part of my \*\*AI Training - GitHub Task 1\*\* submission.
